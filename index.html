                <!-- I am a product of my abilities not my circumstances. -->
                My name is Denzell Devonte Dixon, I am a programmer,
                an immigrant, an astronomer and most of all an engineer.
                I love computers, animation, programming, helping others and 
                building things. I want to be a part of the future. I want to 
                help build quantum computers, develop genetic algorithims and 
                create the world's first artficial inteligence. But for now, I 
                will settle with making my own personal website.
                <!-- I am also a nerd, I am happy that you would 
                    take time out of your day to look at my code. I hope it 
                    suits your taste. If you would like to suggest changes, just
                    fork and clone this on github.  
                -->

            <p id = "aspirations">
                <!-- The heights by great men reached and kept
                    were not attained by sudden flight, but 
                    they, while their companions slept, were 
                    toiling upward in the night. 
                -->
                In college, I would like to study both Computer 
                Science and Computer Engineering. I would like
                to become an engineer that has a strong foundation
                on both the cpu and the code. I believe as technology
                ventures into a new type of computing, we will need
                to go back to the drawing board. We will need to go
                back to the transister so we can develop a new form 
                of computing and a new future for technolgy.

                <!-- Alone we can do so little; 
                    together we can do so much. 
                -->
                When programming, there is a limit to how much that 
                you can do by yourself. I have learned this 
                the hard way. As a result of this, I have made many
                friends in the programming field. Someone who I occasionaly
                work together on programming projects with is my friend
                Omar Cobas.
