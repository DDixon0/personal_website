            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p id = "aboutme">
                 I am a product of my abilities not my circumstances. 
                My name is Denzell Devonte Dixon, I am a programmer,
                an immigrant, an astronomer and most of all an engineer.
                I love computers, animation, programming, helping others and 
                building things. I want to be a part of the future. I want to 
                help build quantum computers, develop genetic algorithims and 
                create the world's first artficial inteligence. But for now, I 
                will settle with making my own personal website.
                     I am also a nerd, I am happy that you would 
                    take time out of your day to look at my code. I hope it 
                    suits your taste. If you would like to suggest changes, just
                    fork and clone this on github.  
                
                 Born too young to explore the world, too early to explore the Universe.

                 The heights by great men reached and kept
                    were not attained by sudden flight, but 
                    they, while their companions slept, were 
                    toiling upward in the night. 
                
                In college, I would like to study both Computer 
                Science and Computer Engineering. I would like
                to become an engineer that has a strong foundation
                on both the cpu and the code. I believe as technology
                ventures into a new type of computing, we will need
                to go back to the drawing board. We will need to go
                back to the transister so we can develop a new form 
                of computing and a new future for technolgy.

                 Alone we can do so little; 
                    together we can do so much. 
            
                When programming, there is a limit to how much that 
                you can do by yourself. I have learned this 
                the hard way. As a result of this, I have made many
                friends in the programming field. Someone who I occasionaly
                work together on programming projects with is my friend
                Omar Cobas.
